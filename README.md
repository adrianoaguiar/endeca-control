==============

Endeca process control utility

This is an application to control Endeca process from start to finish, effectively replacing run_baseline.bat file that comes included with Endeca installation. It's more customizable and can be run as part of a larger system. 

NOTE: The application is unfinished and will need to be updated. Unit tests need to be added, along with some other parts of the process that will need to be revised such as backup creation and imporing post-forge dimensions into the Endeca Workbench tool.
